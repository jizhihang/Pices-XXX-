The code contained in this directory is a modified version of the  
USF Correlation Neural Network (UsfCasCor) which was ported from 
Scott Fahlman's implementation (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sef/).

I wrapped this particular implementaton into a c++ class called 
"UsfCasCor" to simplify its integration into the Pices system.
