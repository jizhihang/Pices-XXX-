This is a modified version of the C port of Scott Fahlman's 
Cascade Correlation Neural Network. It is designed to read in 
C4.5 format files, and all options can be set via the command
line. The default functionality remains the same, however many
other features have been added. See the command line help 
(usfcascor --help) for full details.
