   *@brief  Used to deal with issues related to thread synchronization issues when sharing the same variables.  
   *@details Use the GoalKeeper::Create method to create an instance of this class.  The Create method will ensure 
   *that two different threads don't accidently create two different instances of the same GoalKeeper object.
   *
   *GoalKeeper has a concept of levels of depth. That is a particular thread may call 'StartBlock' more than once, 
   *each time doing so it would be one level deeper.  In this case it would have to call 'EndBlock' an equal number
   *of times to actually release the block.  Imagine that you have a function that Starts and Ends a Block but can
   *be called from the middle of another function that also Starts and Ends a block on the same GoalKeeper object.
   *
   *This class is meant to function the same under Windows or Linux
   *@todo  Has not been debugged under Linux or Solaris yet.
