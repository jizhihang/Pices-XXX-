/**
 *@class KKU::Blob
 *@brief Used by the Raster object to identify a distinct blob; where it is in the raster and its unique id.
 *
 *@details It is used by the Raster object while performing a connected component analysis.  For each distinct
 *         blob located an instance of this class will be created.  Its location in the raster and its unique
 *         blob ID will be stored here.  These blobs will later be able to be extracted from the image by
 *         referencing this blob.
 *
 *         The "id" field in this blob will be stored in a array in the associated Raster object.   This allows
 *         the Raster object to identify the specific pixels that belong to this Blob.  Using the fields "colLeft"
 *         "colRight", "rowBot", and "rowTop" the Raster object will be able to quickly locate the associated
 *         blob.
