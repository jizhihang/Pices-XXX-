   *@brief Base class of all other classes that is meant to be managed by 'BaseLibrary'
   *@details  'Atom' will have a few important virtual methods that all derived classses will be 
   *          required to implement.  This wil lallow for the smooth functioning of XML 
   *          file reading and writing.  Ex: 'WriteXML',  this method is to write a XML version
   *          of the derived class to a output stream.  A regisered BuildFromXML function will 
   *          be able to create a new instance of the derived class.
   *
   *          Create on 2010-02-22;  primary purpose is ti help generate more ideas along these 
   *          lines.
